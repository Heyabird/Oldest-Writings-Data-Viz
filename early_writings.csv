Narmer Palette,Ancient Egypt,3100 BCE,-3100,Early Dynastic Period,Nekhen (Egypt),,Egypt,Cairo, Egypt,inscription,siltstone,palette,Egyptian hieroglyph,none,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narmer_Palette,"The tablet is thought by some to depict the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the king Narmer. Along with the Scorpion Macehead and the Narmer Maceheads, also found together in the main deposit at Nekhen, the Narmer Palette provides one of the earliest known depictions of an Egyptian king. On one side, the king is depicted with the bulbed White Crown of Upper (southern) Egypt, and the other side depicts the king wearing the level Red Crown of Lower (northern) Egypt, which also makes it the earliest known example of a king wearing both types of headdress. Egyptologists Bob Brier and A. Hoyt Hobbs have referred to the Narmer Palette as 'The oldest Egyptian historical record'."
Palermo Stone,Ancient Egypt,2338 BCE,-2338,Old Kingdom,Memphis and Middle Egypt (Egypt),Mit Rahina, Egypt,Palermo, Italy,inscription,black stone (probably basalt),stele,Egyptian hieroglyph,right_to_left,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palermo_Stone,"The Palermo Stone is one of seven surviving fragments of a stele known as the Royal Annals of the Old Kingdom of Ancient Egypt. The stele contained a list of the kings of Egypt from the First Dynasty (c. 3150–2890 BCE) through to the early part of the Fifth Dynasty (c. 2392–2283 BCE) and noted significant events in each year of their reigns. It was probably made during the Fifth Dynasty. The term 'Palermo Stone' is sometimes applied to all seven surviving fragments of the Royal Annals including those held in museums in Cairo and London. The fragments are also sometimes described collectively as the 'Cairo Annals Stone' although the term 'Cairo Stone' is also used to mean only those fragments of the Royal Annals now in Cairo."

They are the oldest known papyri with text, dating to the 26th year of the reign of Pharaoh Khufu (reigned in the early 26th century BC, estimated c. 2589 – c. 2566 BC) during the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt. The text, written with (hieratic) hieroglyphs, mostly consists of lists of the daily activities of Merer and his crew. The best preserved sections (Papyrus Jarf A and B) document the transportation of white limestone blocks from the Tura quarries to Giza by boat."

The tablet, measuring 11.6 cm high and 5 cm wide, documents a transaction in which Ea-nāṣir,[a] a trader, allegedly sold sub-standard copper to a customer named Nanni. Nanni, dissatisfied with the quality, wrote a cuneiform complaint addressing the poor service and mistreatment of his servant. <br/>Written in Akkadian cuneiform, this tablet is recognized as the "Oldest Customer Complaint" by Guinness World Records. From 2015 onwards, the tablet's content and Ea-nāṣir in particular gained popularity as an internet meme, due to its modern-sounding nature of dissatisfaction with goods.",

The find, believed to be part of a tablet from a royal archives, further testifies to the importance of Jerusalem as a major city in the Late Bronze Age, long before its conquest by King David, they say. <br/> The words the symbols form are not significant in themselves, but what is significant is that the script is of a very high level, testifying to the fact that it was written by a highly skilled scribe that in all likelihood prepared tablets for the royal household of the time, said Prof. Wayne Horowitz, a scholar of Assyriology at the Hebrew University Institute of Archaeology."
Oracle Bone,China,1200 BCE,-1200,Shang Dynasty,Anyang (China),Anyang,China,Beijing,China,inscription,ox scapula,oracle bone,early Chinese,top_to_bottom,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_bone,"Oracle bone recording divinations by Zhēng 爭, one of the Bīn 賓 group of diviners from period I, corresponding to the reign of King Wu Ding (late Shang dynasty).<br/> Oracle bones are pieces of ox scapula and turtle plastron which were used in pyromancy – a form of divination – during the Late Shang period (c. 1250 – c. 1050 BCE) in ancient China. Scapulimancy is the specific term if ox scapulae were used for the divination, plastromancy if turtle plastrons were used. A recent count estimated that there were about 13,000 bones with a total of a little over 130,000 inscriptions in collections in China and some fourteen other countries. <br/> Diviners would submit questions to deities regarding weather, crop planting, the fortunes of members of the royal family, military endeavors, and similar topics. These questions were carved onto the bone or shell in oracle bone script using a sharp tool. Intense heat was then applied with a metal rod until the bone or shell cracked due to thermal expansion. The diviner would then interpret the pattern of cracks and write the prognostication upon the piece as well. Pyromancy with bones continued in China into the Zhou dynasty, but the questions and prognostications were increasingly written with brushes and cinnabar ink, which degraded over time."

Great Psalms Scroll (11Q5) (Part of Dead Sea Scrolls),Jewish,300 BCE - 0 BCE,-300,Second Temple period,Qumran Caves,Qumran,West Bank,Jerusalem,Israel,carbon ink,parchment,scroll,Biblical style Hebrew,right_to_left,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Psalms_Scroll#cite_note-1,"The Great Psalms Scroll, also referred to as 11Q5, is the most substantial and well preserved manuscript of Psalms of the thirty-seven discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls in the Qumran caves. It is one of six Psalms manuscripts discovered in Cave 11. <br/>The Dead Sea Scrolls, also called the Qumran Caves Scrolls, are a set of ancient Jewish manuscripts from the Second Temple period. They were discovered over a period of 10 years, between 1946 and 1956, at the Qumran Caves near Ein Feshkha in the West Bank, on the northern shore of the Dead Sea. Dating from the 3rd century BCE to the 1st century CE,[1] the Dead Sea Scrolls include the oldest surviving manuscripts of entire books later included in the biblical canons, including deuterocanonical manuscripts from late Second Temple Judaism and extrabiblical books. At the same time, they cast new light on the emergence of Christianity and of Rabbinic Judaism.[2] Almost all of the 15,000 scrolls and scroll fragments are held in the Shrine of the Book at the Israel Museum located in Jerusalem. The Israeli government's custody of the Dead Sea Scrolls is disputed by Jordan and the Palestinian Authority on territorial, legal, and humanitarian grounds—they were mostly discovered following the Jordanian annexation of the West Bank and were acquired by Israel after Jordan lost the 1967 Arab–Israeli War[3]—whilst Israel's claims are primarily based on historical and religious grounds, given their significance in Jewish history and in the heritage of Judaism."

They are thought to have been found in western Pakistan, the location of Gandhara, buried in ancient monasteries. A team has been at work, trying to decipher the manuscripts: several volumes have appeared to date (see below). The manuscripts were written in the Gāndhārī language using the Kharoṣṭhī script and are therefore sometimes also called the Kharoṣṭhī Manuscripts. <br/> The collection is composed of a diversity of texts: a Dhammapada, discourses of the Buddha such as the Rhinoceros Sutra, avadanas and Purvayogas, commentaries and abhidharma texts."
